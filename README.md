# Canonical class generator

Run ```make``` the command will create the executable ```class``` and move it to ```~bin/```

To use the generator type the following command (replace <A>, <B>, <...> by the name of the class you want to create: ```class <A> <B> <...>"```
  
If it doesn't work, try to moove the executable by yourself to the correct binary path using the command ```mv class <PATH_TO_BINARIES>```
  
When it works you can delete this repository.
