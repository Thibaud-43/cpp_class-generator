# Canonical class generator

Run ```make``` , the command will create the executable ```class``` and move it to ```~bin/```

To use the generator execute the following command : ```class <A> <B> <...>"``` (replace <A>, <B>, <...> by the name of the class you want to create)
  
If it doesn't work, try to moove the executable ```class``` by yourself to the correct binaries path using the command ```mv class <PATH_TO_BINARIES>```
  
When it works you can delete this repository.
